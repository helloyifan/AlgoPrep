You are given an integer n. There are n rooms numbered from 0 to n - 1.

You are given a 2D integer array meetings where meetings[i] = [starti, endi] means that a meeting will be held during the half-closed time interval [starti, endi). All the values of starti are unique.

Meetings are allocated to rooms in the following manner:

Each meeting will take place in the unused room with the lowest number.
If there are no available rooms, the meeting will be delayed until a room becomes free. The delayed meeting should have the same duration as the original meeting.
When a room becomes unused, meetings that have an earlier original start time should be given the room.
Return the number of the room that held the most meetings. If there are multiple rooms, return the room with the lowest number.

A half-closed interval [a, b) is the interval between a and b including a and not including b.

 

Example 1:

Input: n = 2, meetings = [[0,10],[1,5],[2,7],[3,4]]
Output: 0
Explanation:
- At time 0, both rooms are not being used. The first meeting starts in room 0.
- At time 1, only room 1 is not being used. The second meeting starts in room 1.
- At time 2, both rooms are being used. The third meeting is delayed.
- At time 3, both rooms are being used. The fourth meeting is delayed.
- At time 5, the meeting in room 1 finishes. The third meeting starts in room 1 for the time period [5,10).
- At time 10, the meetings in both rooms finish. The fourth meeting starts in room 0 for the time period [10,11).
Both rooms 0 and 1 held 2 meetings, so we return 0. 
Example 2:

Input: n = 3, meetings = [[1,20],[2,10],[3,5],[4,9],[6,8]]
Output: 1
Explanation:
- At time 1, all three rooms are not being used. The first meeting starts in room 0.
- At time 2, rooms 1 and 2 are not being used. The second meeting starts in room 1.
- At time 3, only room 2 is not being used. The third meeting starts in room 2.
- At time 4, all three rooms are being used. The fourth meeting is delayed.
- At time 5, the meeting in room 2 finishes. The fourth meeting starts in room 2 for the time period [5,10).
- At time 6, all three rooms are being used. The fifth meeting is delayed.
- At time 10, the meetings in rooms 1 and 2 finish. The fifth meeting starts in room 1 for the time period [10,12).
Room 0 held 1 meeting while rooms 1 and 2 each held 2 meetings, so we return 1.

Approaches
(Also explained in the code)

Initialization:

We initialize two vectors: ans to keep track of the number of meetings each person attends, and times to keep track of the end time of each person's last meeting.
Both vectors are initialized with zeros.
Sorting Meetings:

We sort the meetings based on their start times. This helps us process them in chronological order.
Processing Meetings:

For each meeting, we find the person who has the earliest available time slot to attend the meeting.
If there's a person available (i.e., their last meeting ends before the current meeting starts), we assign them to attend the meeting and update their end time.
If no person is available, we find the person who has the earliest end time among all persons and assign them to attend the meeting. We also update their end time accordingly.
Finding Most Booked:

After processing all meetings, we find the person who attended the maximum number of meetings.
We iterate through the ans vector and find the person with the highest count of attended meetings.
Return Result:

We return the ID of the person who attended the most meetings.
Complexity
Time complexity:
O(nlogn)

Space complexity:
O(n)

Code
class Solution:
    def mostBooked(self, n: int, meetings: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        ans = [0] * n
        times = [0] * n
        meetings.sort()

        for start, end in meetings:
            flag = False
            minind = -1
            val = float('inf')
            for j in range(n):
                if times[j] < val:
                    val = times[j]
                    minind = j
                if times[j] <= start:
                    flag = True
                    ans[j] += 1
                    times[j] = end
                    break
            if not flag:
                ans[minind] += 1
                times[minind] += (end - start)

        maxi = -1
        id = -1
        for i in range(n):
            if ans[i] > maxi:
                maxi = ans[i]
                id = i
        return id
